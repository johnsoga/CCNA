## TCP/IP

TCP/IP model is defined in [RFC 1180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1180). Originally conceived by the US DOD as a means to create an open networking model to replace various vendors proprietary models. This would allow more networks to be able to communicate with each other with less complications. It was competing with the International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) OSI Networking model, defined in [ISO 7498](https://www.iso.org/standard/20269.html)/[ITU-T X.200](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.200-199407-I/).
